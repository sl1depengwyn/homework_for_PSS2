## About

This is an ideal access system for university, for example.

Many thanks to the contributors!

## Details

My system has the following unique and extremly useful features:
It can wish happy birthday!
It knows favorite jokes of professors!
It has the most realistic model of student that can shushukatsa or nyit'!
It has the model of a very kind director that can decrease scholarships!

You know whether room has markers(and add), whether batteries in mic(and add), is it clean or not
and you know who cleaned the room!

## Usage


```shell script
cd ../hw2
g++ -o filename admin.cpp cabinet.cpp classRoom.cpp common.h conferenceRoom.cpp director.cpp directorCabinet.cpp labEmployee.cpp lectureRoom.cpp main.cpp person.cpp professor.cpp room.cpp student.cpp
